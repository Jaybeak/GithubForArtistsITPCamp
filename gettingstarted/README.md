# Getting Started! 

Example adapted from
https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-particle-system.html


In lamens terms. 

* When I am done working on a file I "add" it
    * When you Add a file, you "stage" it which means you are preparing it to be committed
* Then I "commit" it
    * When you commit a file you are associated the changes you made in that file with a specific index
    * You're making the changes to your 'local' repository 
* Then I "Push" it
    * Upload those changes to the remote repository
